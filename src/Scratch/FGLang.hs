-- a pusher is guaranteed to push all it can over at once only if f is pointed and props hold.

-- (i think) a copusher .. iff f is copointed and props hold

-- this effectively reduces (f+gf*) to (fgf?), OMG: is this reduction a pushing of compositions of f inside?
--   yeah, what I've done is taken the set of words in the language, partitioned them on their compositions without all of the (return)'s, and given you a view inside that newly partitioned language.
--   Really, really cool. I think this means that the partition interpretation mught be precise.
--   ok, so let's say we have a partition (p), which is a natual transformation from (g a) to some index functor.
--     ahh, since p is an endofunctor, we only really need to have `p` be an injection, and can make the index functor `f (g a)`
--     really, we want the maximal (f (g a) -> f (f (g a))) function such that pushing over pushes everything that can be over,
--     we want to partition on (g a) such that we can reconstruct the structure of a connected component of g's in the partition inside of (g a)
--  in other words, we need to ensure that the lines of the connected components do not cross the lines of what parts of `f` can be passed through `g`.
--    first of all, in what sense does `f` form a graph, that we can accurrately describe what parts are adjacent?
--      if `f` is pointed, then those components that cannot pass through are those such that: (push == fmap (fmap return) :: f . g -> f . g . f)
--      so we get a relation `can pass through(To) :: f g (a)`, where push is non-trivial
--      we can also use (return) to specify that everything has passed through. we then can know: has anything passed through on `x` step, has everything passed through, really everything about what has passed through when
--      p  :: g a -> b
--      p' :: f (g a) -> b
--      p' (return x) = p x
--      extractor :: f b -> maybe b
--      p' = extractor . fmap p
--      extractor (p <$> return x) = p x
--      ahh, we can have a natural extractor, \y -> { x | f associates x with y} :: f (g a) -> {g a}
--      so we require that. \y -> forall (x :: g a). f x == y => p x :: f (g a) -> Bool (the property maps all of the elements of the preimage to the same value)
--       and that holds forall (f (g a)) `elem` (f (f (g a)))
--       which also has a most general format of: \y -> { x | f associates x with y && x `elem` y}
--       which I believe is both a valid inclusion and the most general inclusion
--       valid inclusion: (x `elem` return x), x `elem` y => forall f. f x `elem` fmap f y
--         if this is all we need then we get it from (x `elem` return x) and f being a functor [else hi]
--           (all singleton (== return x) preimages for `f` implies f == const | identity?)
--      and this predicate has: fmap pred . partition == fmap (const True) . partition
--      and the partition is preserved by crossing `g`?

-- alright, we want to classify each operation as being idempotent, and find what results we have.
--   we already have that all being idempotent implies that `f` is pointed and the second operation is equivalent to fmapping the pointing function up to the difference in types

-- since the category probably doesn't have bool, if it's the unit category then the partition is trivial, else it holds for mapping any pair of elements of C to (False, True)
-- really, it works either way, so we can just skip to it:
--  the checker does (if pred then xx else yy) and then we have: fmap checker . partition == fmap (const xx) . partition
--  question: is the checker function a valid function in the category? I'm not sure.
--  we may have to fall back to a fold.

-- We want: `Functor` isomorphisms between these compositions of @F@ and @G@:
--
-- @
--  F(G(A))    -- we have a composition of functors
--  F(F(G(A))) -- we partition the outer functor into pieces such that `unique partition (xs :: f (g a))` is true for our partition (if it exists, of course, that's where graph coloring comes in)
--  F(G(F(A))) -- we push the partition into the inner functor, resulting in the connected (f (g a)) pieces being joined along their partitions.
-- @
--
-- In other words, it pulls the partition up to @F@'s level while pushing the structure of @F@ down into @G@.
-- The structure of @F@ is available to @G@ in slices (local by definition of the partition).
--
-- Note: all of these operations are invertible since we have unique partitions (though I think I'm missing some constraints?)
--
-- Additionally, the functors which this works for are local functors and computers _really_ like computational and data locality.
-- Computational locality makes stream and massively parallel processing a breeze (case in point, the line-by-line parser I just wrote).

--   f :: X -> Y => F(G(f)) :: F(G(X)) -> F(G(Y))

--   X :: C => eta_1(X) :: F(G(X)) -> F(F(G(X))) :: C -> C

--   X :: C => eta_3(X) :: F(G(F(X))) -> F(G(X)) :: C -> C
--
--   f :: X -> Y :: C -> C => eta_1(Y) . F(G(f)) = F(F(G(f))) . eta_1(X) :: F(G(X)) -> F(F(G(Y))) :: C -> C
--   f :: X -> Y :: C -> C => eta_2(Y) . F(F(G(f))) = F(G(F(f))) . eta_2(X) :: F(F(G(X))) -> F(G(F(Y))) :: C -> C
--   f :: X -> Y :: C -> C => eta_3(Y) . F(G(F(f))) = F(G(f)) . eta_3(X) :: F(G(F(X))) -> F(G(Y)) :: C -> C
